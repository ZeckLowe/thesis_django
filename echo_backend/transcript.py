Um then we'll go do tool training, talk about the project plan, discuss our own ideas and everything um and we've got twenty five minutes to do that, as far as I can understand. Now, we're developing a remote control which you probably already know. Um, we want it to be original, something that's uh people haven't thought of, that's not out in the shops, um, trendy, appealing to a wide market, but you know, not a hunk of metal, and user-friendly, grannies to kids, maybe even pooches should be able to use it. Okay, um, first is the functional design, um this is where we all go off and do our individual work, um what needs need to be fulfilled by the product, um what effects the product has to have and how it's actually going to do that. Um, conceptual design, what we're thinking, how it's gonna go and then the detailed design, how we're actually gonna put it into practice and make it work.", "speakerName": "Project Manager"}, {"text": "'Kay.", "speakerName": "User Interface"}, {"text": "Okay, right.

Or what about kind of a dual function? In that you've got the basic buttons just for your play, volume, programme things", "speakerName": "Project Manager"}, {"text": "Mm-hmm.", "speakerName": "Marketing"}, {"text": "and also and then a menu to go into with obvious pictures, obvious symbols and that's where you control recording and things like that.", "speakerName": "Project Manager"}, {"text": "Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm. The other thing is, just ch chucking into mobile phone f design features again, it could have a flip top remote control so that when you flip over the top, your screen is you can have a bigger screen in the the flip over.", "speakerName": "Marketing"}, {"text": "Mm-hmm.", "speakerName": "Project Manager"}, {"text": "Mm, okay.

Just just a quick thing about the um.", "speakerName": "Industrial Designer"}, {"text": "Sure.", "speakerName": "Project Manager"}, {"text": "about what you're saying about the uh does does it need to be fashionable? The sort of I I had a quick look at the company website and it's like the the uh we put the fashion into electronics, so I think think the whole design thing might be qui", "speakerName": "Industrial Designer"}, {"text": "Ah right.", "speakerName": "Marketing"}, {"text": "Okay.", "speakerName": "User Interface"}, {"text": "Okay.", "speakerName": "Project Manager"}, {"text": "Okay.", "speakerName": "Marketing"}, {"text": "I mean you don't you you can still have plastic", "speakerName": "Industrial Designer"}, {"text": "Sure b y yeah.", "speakerName": "Marketing"}, {"text": "and it'd look quite good but.", "speakerName": "Industrial Designer"}, {"text": "But yeah, I mean it doesn't have to be that, you know th that was my main point,", "speakerName": "Marketing"}, {"text": "Yeah.", "speakerName": "Industrial Designer"}, {"text": "we don't have to use metal, I don't know if using plastic does make it cheaper,", "speakerName": "Marketing"}, {"text": "Mm.", "speakerName": "Project Manager"}, {"text": "I presume it would.", "speakerName": "Marketing"}, {"text": "I would.", "speakerName": "Project Manager"}, {"text": "Yeah.
